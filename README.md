Looking at Fantasy Football data and trends from the 2021-2022 NFL season

# Hypothesis 

## Our graph defines a metric which shows how efficient a player is and how much a player is used. Our metric defines 4 types of players:
### 1. Promising: these players ahve high efficiency (PPT) but low usage.
### 2. The Best: these players have high efficiency and high usage.
### 3. The Worst: these players have low efficiency and low usage.
### 4. Dominant: these players have high usage but low efficiency.

In order to test this hypothesis, we will be testing our metric's ability to determine whether a player is bad. We will test this ability by comparing our list of The Worst fantasy players to the consensus rankings by fantasy experts on fantasypros.com.
